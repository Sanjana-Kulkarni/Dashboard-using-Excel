Learned various visualization methods to represent data effectively.

Dashboard Creation with Bike Buyers Dataset:
Successfully created a functional dashboard using Google Sheets, showcasing multiple visualizations answering specific questions:
Bar Chart (Marital Status): Explored bike purchases across different marital statuses.
Bar Chart (Gender): Compared bike purchases between genders.
Histograms (Income, Age): Analyzed income and age distributions among bike buyers.
Box Plot (Income): Identified outliers in income distribution and their potential impact on purchasing behavior.
Pie Chart (Region): Displayed bike purchases distribution by region.
Scatter Plot (Income vs. Age): Investigated the relationship between income and age.
Stacked Bar Chart (Marital Status & Gender): Analyzed the combined influence of marital status and gender on bike purchases.
Correlation Heatmap: Visualized correlations among numeric variables to understand their impact on purchasing behavior.

Insights and Observations:
Discovered interesting trends, such as potential correlations between certain demographics and bike purchases.
Noticed outliers in income and age, prompting further investigation into their influence on buying behavior.
Found varying purchase patterns across regions, suggesting regional preferences in bike purchases.

Challenges Faced:
Data Preprocessing Complexity: Dealing with null values and ensuring accurate cleaning presented some challenges initially.
Interpreting Outliers: Understanding the implications of outliers in income and age required additional analysis.

Next Steps:
Further Analysis: Dive deeper into the outliers identified and explore their impact on purchasing behavior.
Advanced Visualization Techniques: Explore more advanced visualization tools and techniques in Google Sheets or other platforms.
Enhance Insights: Seek to derive more nuanced insights by combining different variables and conducting deeper analyses.

Conclusion: 
Proved to be an enriching experience in understanding data analysis fundamentals and applying them practically to derive insights from real-world data. The creation of the dashboard not only showcased acquired skills but also unearthed intriguing patterns and trends within the Bike Buyers Dataset.
